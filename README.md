Windstorm
=========
Windstorm is a simple window creation library for Go. It creates OpenGL
contexts and handles user input. The library is comparable to GLFW, but not so
complete.

Full disclosure: Work on this project is based on an earlier attempt at the
idea, but I'm doing everything over again, so I believe I'm in the green,
rule-wise. This does give me a bit of a head-start, though, as I've already
done a lot of the research.
